## Introduction

Coqui Frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui), native to Puerto Rico, have become a prominent invasive species in Maui. Their presence is notable due to the loud mating calls of males, which can disrupt local ecosystems and human habitats.

## Impact of Coqui Frogs

- **Noise Pollution**: Male Coqui Frogs emit loud calls at night, which can be disruptive to residents and decrease property values.
- **Environmental Impact**: Coqui Frogs consume a vast amount of insects, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the local ecosystem.
- **Agricultural Damage**: These frogs can also be a nuisance in nurseries and gardens, where their high population densities can lead to significant plant damage.

## Identifying Coqui Frogs

- **Size**: Small, typically about 1-2 inches in length.
- **Color**: Generally light brown to dark brown.
- **Sound**: Known for their distinctive "ko-kee" call that occurs from dusk till dawn.

## Management Strategies

### Physical Removal

- Manually capturing and removing frogs is a common method employed during nighttime when they are most active and their calls are audible.

### Habitat Modification

- Removing vegetation and debris that can serve as hiding spots for Coqui Frogs reduces their preferred habitat.
- Ensuring that nurseries and gardens are not overly moist can deter frog populations from establishing.

### Chemical Control

- Citric acid and hydrated lime have been used effectively to reduce Coqui Frog populations. These treatments need to be applied carefully to minimize impacts on other wildlife and plants.

## Reporting Sightings

Prompt reporting of Coqui Frog sightings can help manage their spread and establish control measures effectively:

Understanding and addressing the spread of Coqui Frogs is crucial for protecting Maui's biodiversity and maintaining quality of life for its residents.
